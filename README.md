# Stay at home and learn code : Day 1 - Disjoint sets
## The problem
The problem itself is fairly simple : given a list of individuals and a list of connections between them, compute the equivalent classes / partitions of this population.

We need to define two methods :
* union : merge two classes
* find : get individual's class

N is population size, C the number of connections provided
