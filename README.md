## Day 1 - Disjoint sets
### The problem
The problem itself is fairly simple : given a list of individuals and a list of connections between them, compute the equivalent classes / partitions of this population.

### The demo
[Give a try](https://dpamar.github.io/learncode/day1/index-ds.html) - and [see one possible application (Kruskal's algorithm)](https://dpamar.github.io/learncode/day1/index-kruskal.html)

## Day 2 - Gesture recognition
### The problem
Try to recognize digits, not using shape recognition (like SIFT, or advanced ML techniques), but using gesture recognition. Simple and efficient

### The demo
[Give a try](https://dpamar.github.io/learncode/day2/index-gesture.html) and also to [the preconfigured version](https://dpamar.github.io/learncode/day2/index-preconfigured.html)

## Day 3 - Quines
### The problem
Code a quine, a program able to return its own source code.

### The demo
[Give a try to the verbose implementation](https://dpamar.github.io/learncode/day3/index-quine-array.html) or [the compact one](https://dpamar.github.io/learncode/day3/index-quine-array.html)

## Day 4 - Markov chains
### The problem
Predict the future, and optimize your Monopoly strategy

### The demo
[Give a try](https://dpamar.github.io/learncode/day4/index-markov.html) or [have a look at Monopoly strategy](https://dpamar.github.io/learncode/day4/index-monopoly.html)

## Day 5 - Convex hull
### The problem
Compute the convex envelope, the smallest convex set containing a cloud of points

### The demo
[Give a try](https://dpamar.github.io/learncode/day5/index-hull.html)
