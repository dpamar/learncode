## Day 1 - Disjoint sets
### The problem
The problem itself is fairly simple : given a list of individuals and a list of connections between them, compute the equivalent classes / partitions of this population.

### The demo
[Give a try](https://dpamar.github.io/learncode/day1/index-ds.html) - and [see one possible application (Kruskal's algorithm)](https://dpamar.github.io/learncode/day1/index-kruskal.html)

## Day 2 - Gesture recognition
### The problem
Try to recognize digits, not using shape recognition (like SIFT, or advanced ML techniques), but using gesture recognition. Simple and efficient

### The demo
[Give a try](https://dpamar.github.io/learncode/day2/index-gesture.html)

## Day 3 - Quines
### The problem
Code a quine, a program able to return its own source code.

### The demo
[Give a try to the verbose implementation](https://dpamar.github.io/learncode/day3/index-quine-array.html) or [the compact one](https://dpamar.github.io/learncode/day3/index-quine-array.html)
